# Transcribed from http://code.activestate.com/recipes/523034/ on May 1, 2009
# by Jef Spaleta This code provides an emulation for the defaultdict
# functionality introduced in python 2.5's collection module
#
# Changes from the original:
# * Change the return value from __reduce__ to use iteritems() to prevent
#   a segfault when pickling. (Jef Spaleta)
# * Change how we setup the module to use collections.defaultdict by default

defaultdict
-----------

This is a pure python implementation of defaultdict that is compatible with
the defaultdict class provided by python-2.5 and above.

.. seealso::
    :class:`collections.defaultdict`
        for documentation on this module
