This module returns the preferred default CA certificate bundle.

If you are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed
environment, you can change the definition of where() to return a separately
packaged CA bundle.

We return "/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt" provided by the ca-certificates
package.
